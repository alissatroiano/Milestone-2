## UX

The primary goals of, ' Game Of Facts' are:

* Create an interactive trivia game that is both informative and fun.

* Present historical/factual information in a fun and learnable way.

***NOTE: This game should not be played by anybody who has not finished the television or book series, as it may contain spoilers.***

The trade-off activity can be viewed in full in this [document](wireframes/strategy.pdf)

Once the strategy exercises were completed, the following wireframes were created by the [developer](https://www.github.com/alissatroiano) to guide the development process.

## UX Design

### Typography

The fonts selected for this project were:

1. Trajan-Pro-3, serif
2. Futura PT, sans-serif

The developer selected these fonts because:

* Trajan-Pro-3 is the font used for the official Game Of Thrones logo. It is widely recognized by Game Of Thrones fans and brings the right aesthetic to this web-based trivia game. This font was selected and used to style page titles, questions, progress, final score, and the game logo.

* Futura PT is a clean and modern sans-serif font that is recognizable and appealing to the project's target market. This font was chosen for answer explanations, multiple choices, navigation links, and other body text to compliment the Trajan-Pro-3, serif font.

## Color Palette

The following color palette was chosen by the [developer](https://github.com/alissatroiano) for this project:
